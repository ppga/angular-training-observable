Simple excersises on angular 8 observables
Based on [Djamware programming blog](https://www.djamware.com/post/5da31946ae418d042e1aef1d/angular-8-tutorial-observable-and-rxjs-examples):
1. Non-visual (console.log output) component **basic-observable** - chaining **of** observable and **timer** observable
2. Non-visual component **seq-observer** - defining observable as function passed to the constructor
3. Visual component **esc-input** - observable HTML event (KeyboardEvent), clears text input line when ESC is pressed

*Because of the apparent problems that StackBlitz still has with github integration, a new branch had to be created (escape-stackblitz-problems) in order to be able to commit changes again*
